# Archbot

The Archbot is designed to offer unsolicited advice from a JSON file of possible
advices. That's all it does, and it's not good, and I'm not proud of it.

Configure the words that the Archbot will respond to by customizing the 
`wake_words` key in `config.json`. By default, Archbot responds to the word 
"archbot" (wake words are not case sensitive).
